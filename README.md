# HackRiceX | First Timer's Track

## Track Description

We live in a society where everything is customized, from your phone case to your coffee order. So why shouldn't your browser be too? Chrome extensions allow you to craft and tailor your ideal browsing experience in a few short lines of code. In this track, you'll build a Chrome extension from scratch using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

## Introduction

Welcome to HackRice 10! This track is intended for teams in which a majority of members have little to no experience with software development. We'll help you get started by providing instructions on how to set up your environment and providing some basic code for you to expand on. If you have attended previous hackathons, you're still welcome to use the provided code, but you won't be eligible to compete in the First Timers Track.

In this track, you'll create a website related to (raising awareness of) social justice. You can create whatever in your opinion is going to support social justice (and racial equality). We're providing you with boiler plates, but feel free to build from scratch

## Tools Needed

You'll need a basic text editor - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or any other text editor with a live server extension.
